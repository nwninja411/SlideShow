        <p>Horton Creek is a beautiful hike located about 20 miles from Payson, Arizona. Nestled in the Mogollon Rim region, the trail follows a scenic creek the entire way, offering countless photo opportunities along the path. This collection showcases some of the moments I captured during my time exploring Horton Creek. I hope you enjoy the journey!</p>
